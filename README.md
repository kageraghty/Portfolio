# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'll be uploading projects I've worked on to demonstrate my skills in Python, SQL, and visualizations.

## Projects

### 1. [Exit Survey Anaysis](https://github.com/kageraghty/Portfolio/blob/main/Employee%20Exit%20Survey%20Analysis.ipynb)
A project that uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy to analyze datasets containing exit survey data from two institutes in Australia.
